  title = {Design and production of nanoparticles formulated from nano-emulsion
	templates-A review.},
  journal = {J Control Release},
  year = {2008},
  month = {Feb},
  note = {article in press},
  abstract = {A considerable number of nanoparticle formulation methods are based
	on nano-emulsion templates, which in turn are generated in various
	ways. It must therefore be taken into account that active principles
	and drugs encapsulated in nanoparticles can potentially be affected
	by these nano-emulsion formulation processes. Such potential differences
	may include drug sensitivity to temperature, high-shear devices,
	or even contact with organic solvents. Likewise, nano-emulsion formulation
	processes must be chosen in function of the selected therapeutic
	goals of the nano-carrier suspension and its administration route.
	This requires the nanoparticle formulation processes (and thus the
	nano-emulsion formation methods) to be more adapted to the nature
	of the encapsulated drugs, as well as to the chosen route of administration.
	Offering a comprehensive review, this paper proposes a link between
	nano-emulsion formulation methods and nanoparticle generation, while
	at the same time bearing in mind the above-mentioned parameters for
	active molecule encapsulation. The first part will deal with the
	nano-emulsion template through the different formulation methods,
	i.e. high energy methods on the one hand, and low-energy ones (essentially
	spontaneous emulsification and the phase inversion temperature (PIT)
	method) on the other. This will be followed by a review of the different
	families of nanoparticles (i.e. polymeric or lipid nanospheres and
	nanocapsules) highlighting the links (or potential links) between
	these nanoparticles and the different nano-emulsion formulation methods
	upon which they are based.},

  abstract = {Over recent years, drug release/dissolution from solid pharmaceutical
	dosage forms has been the subject of intense and profitable scientific
	developments. Whenever a new solid dosage form is developed or produced,
	it is necessary to ensure that drug dissolution occurs in an appropriate
	manner. The pharmaceutical industry and the registration authorities
	do focus, nowadays, on drug dissolution studies. The quantitative
	analysis of the values obtained in dissolution/release tests is easier
	when mathematical formulas that express the dissolution results as
	a function of some of the dosage forms characteristics are used.
	In some cases, these mathematic models are derived from the theoretical
	analysis of the occurring process. In most of the cases the theoretical
	concept does not exist and some empirical equations have proved to
	be more appropriate. Drug dissolution from solid dosage forms has
	been described by kinetic models in which the dissolved amount of
	drug (Q) is a function of the test time, t or Q=f(t). Some analytical
	definitions of the Q(t) function are commonly used, such as zero
	order, first order, Hixson-Crowell, Weibull, Higuchi, Baker-Lonsdale,
	Korsmeyer-Peppas and Hopfenberg models. Other release parameters,
	such as dissolution time (tx%), assay time (tx min), dissolution
	efficacy (ED), difference factor (f1), similarity factor (f2) and

	solution, valid during the early stages of the release process, was

	the coating solution on the in vitro release profile of theophylline
	for bimodal drug delivery. Artificial neural network (ANN) as a multilayer
	perceptron feedforward network was incorporated for developing a
	predictive model of the formulations. Five different training algorithms
	belonging to three classes: gradient descent, quasi-Newton (Levenberg-Marquardt,
	LM) and genetic algorithm (GA) were used to train ANN containing
	a single hidden layer of four nodes. The next objective of the current
	study was to compare the performance of aforementioned algorithms
	with regard to predicting ability. The ANNs were trained with those
	algorithms using the available experimental data as the training
	set. The divergence of the RMSE between the output and target values
	of test set was monitored and used as a criterion to stop training.
	Two versions of gradient descent backpropagation algorithms, i.e.
	incremental backpropagation (IBP) and batch backpropagation (BBP)
	outperformed the others. No significant differences were found between
	the predictive abilities of IBP and BBP, although, the convergence
	speed of BBP is three- to four-fold higher than IBP. Although, both
	gradient descent backpropagation and LM methodologies gave comparable
	results for the data modeling, training of ANNs with genetic algorithm
	was erratic. The precision of predictive ability was measured for
	each training algorithm and their performances were in the order
	of: IBP, BBP>LM>QP (quick propagation)>GA. According to BBP-ANN implementation,
	an increase in coating levels and a decrease in the amount of pectin-chitosan
	generally retarded the drug release. Moreover, the latter causal
	factor namely the amount of pectin-chitosan played slightly more
	dominant role in determination of the dissolution profiles.},

	and backward stepwise algorithms were used as well as genetic algorithms.
	Networks were subsequently trained using the back propagation algorithm

	any unimportant inputs. IFS gave consistent rankings for the importance
	of the various formulation and processing variables in determining
	the release of drug from minitablets. Consistent ranking was achieved
	for both indices of the release process; ie, the time taken for release
	to commence through the enteric coat (T(lag)) and that for the drug
	to diffuse through the SR matrix of the minitablet into the dissolution
	medium (T9(0-10)). In the case of the T(lag) phase, the main coating
	parameters, along with the original batch blend size and the blend
	time with lubricant, were found to have most influence. By contrast,
	with the T(90-10 phase), the amounts of matrix forming polymer and
	direct compression filler were most important. In the subsequent
	training of the ANNs, removal of inputs regarded as less important
	led to improved network performance. ANNs were capable of ranking
	the relative importance of the various formulations and processing
	variables that influenced the release rate of the drug from minitablets.
	This could be done for all main stages of the release process. Subsequent
	training of the ANN verified that removal of less relevant inputs

	briefly presented. Then, phenomenological empirical models as well
	as models based on diffusion and chemical reaction theory are discussed.
	Due to the significant chemical and physicochemical differences among
	individual bioerodible polymers used for controlled drug delivery
	systems, various mathematical models have been developed to describe
	the chemical reactions and physical mass transport processes involved
	in erosion-controlled drug release. Various examples of practical

	drug delivery systems this will help to choose the appropriate mathematical
	model for a specific drug release problem. Important selection criteria
	such as the desired predictive power and precision, but also the
	effort required to apply a model to a particular system will be discussed.
	Furthermore, before models can be used for drug release predictions
	certain parameters such as drug dissolution or polymer degradation
	rate constants, have to be known. The number of parameters to be
	determined significantly differs between the models. The practical

	drug loadings. The validity of the improved model has been tested
	experimentally using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)-matrices,
